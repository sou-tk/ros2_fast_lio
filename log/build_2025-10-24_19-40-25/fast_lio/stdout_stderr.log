[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:60 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findpcl_ros.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "pcl_ros", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "pcl_ros" with any
  of the following names:

    pcl_rosConfig.cmake
    pcl_ros-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "pcl_ros" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "pcl_ros_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "pcl_ros" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
